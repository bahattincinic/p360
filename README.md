# Project 360 #

A brief todo list for project 360.

### What needs to be done still? ###

* Testing!! We do not know how reliable our code and setup is, so we need a lot of testing at this point
* Docket containers for deploying, one for mongodb db container and another one for app server container, 2 containers in total.
* We need a reliable and automated way to handle deploying updated containers to server, or updating/downloading our code in containers.

* Using sentry for error tracking for meteor js with the help of meteor-raven
