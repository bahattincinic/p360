# Project 360 #

A brief todo list for project 360.

### What needs to be done still? ###

* Testing!! We do not know how reliable our code and setup is, so we need a lot of testing at this point
* Docket containers for deploying, one for mongodb db container, one for app server container and last one as data-only container, 3 containers in total.
* Learn more about data-only container [Docker Pieces Loosly Joined](http://www.offermann.us/2013/12/tiny-docker-pieces-loosely-joined.html)
* We need a reliable and automated way to handle deploying updated containers to server, or updating/downloading our code in containers.
* [Learn Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* Using  [DockerLinks](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerlinks/) we can link multiple docker containers together, no fuss no harm.
* Using sentry for error tracking for meteor js with the help of meteor-raven
